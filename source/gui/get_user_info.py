"""
This module provides a Streamlit-based UI to collect user credentials 
required to connect to an IMAP email server.

It returns a dictionary containing:
    - EMAIL: The user's email address.
    - PASSWORD: An app-specific password (not the regular email password).
    - HOST: The IMAP server hostname (default: imap.gmail.com).
    - PORT: The IMAP port number (default: 993).

Note:
    - For Gmail users, app passwords are required due to security policies.
    - To generate one, enable 2-Step Verification in your Google account 
      and create an App Password.
    - For other providers, update the HOST and PORT fields accordingly.

        Gmail does not allow third-party applications like BetterMail to sign in with your regular password.

        ***If you use your phone as 2FA please do not forget to remove the app password after usage***

        The App Password will be a 16-character code that you can use to sign in here.
